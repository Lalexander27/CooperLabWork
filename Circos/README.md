# Circos Plots
- I [prepared](CircosPrep.Rmd) files of duplications, insertions, and deletions for visualization in circos plots.  
- For each 1M bp interval, I compared counts of features for sweet and biomass strains, then used average difference to organize these intervals in quantiles. 
- For [circos plots](), I visualized intervals that had greatest divergence (top 50 percentiles and top 5 percentiles).
