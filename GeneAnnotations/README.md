# Gene Annotations
1) For each [significant interval](SignificantIntervals.csv), I extracted sorghum genes from a [gff file](Sbicolor_454_Chr03_gene) and matched gene ids to [annotation information](Sbicolor_454_v3.1.1.annotation_info.txt) (GO terms and similar genes in arabidopsis and rice.)
2) Then I performed GO enrichment analyses for the genes in the intervals.
