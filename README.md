# CooperLab
Overall, this project was to identify structural variants in 9 Sorghum bicolor strains.  The genomes were compared to the reference BTx623.
I specifically compared patterns of duplications in sweet (sugar-accumulating) and biomass (tall-growing and leafy) varieties.
1) After obtaining SyRI annotation info for 9 strains, I used [File processing](FileProcessing) to create a master file of all non-overlapping duplications across the strains
2) I plotted patterns of duplications across 1M bp intervals across the genome. [Duplication histograms]()
