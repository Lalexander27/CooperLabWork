SYRI was used on 10 sorghum assemblies to identify structural variants with reference to the BTx623 reference genome.  
1) I extracted specific variant types of interest (e.g. duplications) from each strain's vcf file.
2) Then I formatted this output and marked the occurence of each allele present.
3) Then I merged all formatted files to create a master file of allele occurence across these genomes.
Slurm files show this process and output the final merged file.
