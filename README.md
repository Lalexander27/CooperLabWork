# CooperLab
Overall, this project was to identify structural variants in 9 Sorghum bicolor strains.  The genomes were compared to the reference BTx623.
I specifically compared patterns of duplications in sweet (sugar-accumulating) and biomass (tall-growing and leafy) varieties.
1) After obtaining SyRI annotation info for 9 strains, I used files in [FileProcessing](Lalexander27/CooperLabWork/FileProcessing)
